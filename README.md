# Arduino Maze Game

Team-based embedded systems project developed as part of a 7th semester elective course.

The project implements an interactive maze game using Arduino, combining embedded software, hardware interfacing, and system-level design considerations.

## Project overview
- Physical maze game controlled by an Arduino microcontroller
- User interaction through hardware inputs
- Real-time response using embedded C/C++
- Designed with safety, reliability, and usability in mind

## Technical details
- Microcontroller: Arduino
- Programming language: C/C++ (Arduino)
- Hardware components: sensors, switches, motors (as per lab design)
- Power and safety constraints considered

## Project management aspects
- Defined objectives and customer requirements
- Task distribution within a 4-member team
- Planned schedule, budget, and risk analysis
- Safety considerations for electrical and mechanical components

## Team project
This was a **team project (4 members)** completed as part of an academic elective.

### My contribution
- Embedded software development (Arduino code)
- Integration and testing of hardware inputs
- Debugging and validation of game logic
- Documentation and system analysis

## Notes
- Educational project developed for academic purposes
- Focus on embedded systems concepts rather than production hardware
